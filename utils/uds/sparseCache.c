/**
 * The sparse chapter index cache is implemented as a simple array of cache
 * entries. Since the cache is small (seven chapters by default), searching
 * for a specific virtual chapter is implemented as a linear search. The cache
 * replacement policy is least-recently-used (LRU). Again, size of the cache
 * allows the LRU order to be maintained by shifting entries in an array list.
 *
 * The most important property of this cache is the absence of synchronization
 * for read operations. Safe concurrent access to the cache by the zone
 * threads is controlled by the triage queue and the barrier requests it
 * issues to the zone queues. The set of cached chapters does not and must not
 * change between the carefully coordinated calls to update_sparse_cache() from
 * the zone threads.
 *
 * The critical invariant for that coordination is the cache membership must
 * not change between those updates; the calls to sparse_cache_contains() from
 * the zone threads must all receive the same results for any virtual chapter
 * number. To ensure that critical invariant, state changes such as "that
 * virtual chapter is no longer in the volume" and "skip searching that
 * chapter because it has had too many cache misses" are represented
 * separately from the cache membership information (the virtual chapter
 * number).
 *
 * As a result of this invariant, we have the guarantee that every zone thread
 * will call update_sparse_cache() once and exactly once to request a chapter
 * that is not in the cache, and the serialization of the barrier requests
 * from the triage queue ensures they will all request the same chapter
 * number. This means the only synchronization we need can be provided by a
 * pair of thread barriers used only in the update_sparse_cache() call,
 * providing a critical section where a single zone thread can drive the cache
 * update while all the other zone threads are known to be blocked, waiting in
 * the second barrier. Outside that critical section, all the zone threads
 * implicitly hold a shared lock. Inside it, the "captain" (the thread that
 * was uniquely flagged when passing through the first barrier) holds an
 * exclusive lock. No other threads may access or modify the cache, except for
 * accessing cache statistics and similar queries.
 *
 * Cache statistics must only be modified by a single thread, conventionally
 * the zone zero thread. All fields that might be frequently updated by that
 * thread are kept in separate cache-aligned structures so they will not cause
 * cache contention via "false sharing" with the fields that are frequently
 * accessed by all of the zone threads.
 *
 * LRU order is kept independently by each zone thread, and each zone uses its
 * own list for searching and cache membership queries. The zone zero list is
 * used to decide which chapter to evict when the cache is updated, and its
 * search list is copied to the other threads at that time.
 *
 * The virtual chapter number field of the cache entry is the single field
 * indicating whether a chapter is a member of the cache or not. The value
 * <code>UINT64_MAX</code> is used to represent a null, undefined, or wildcard
 * chapter number. When present in the virtual chapter number field
 * cached_chapter_index, it indicates that the cache entry is dead, and all
 * the other fields of that entry (other than immutable pointers to cache
 * memory) are undefined and irrelevant. Any cache entry that is not marked as
 * dead is fully defined and a member of the cache--sparse_cache_contains()
 * must always return true for any virtual chapter number that appears in any
 * of the cache entries.
 *
 * A chapter index that is a member of the cache may be marked for different
 * treatment (disabling search) between calls to update_sparse_cache() in two
 * different ways. When a chapter falls off the end of the volume, its virtual
 * chapter number will be less that the oldest virtual chapter number. Since
 * that chapter is no longer part of the volume, there's no point in continuing
 * to search that chapter index. Once invalidated, that virtual chapter will
 * still be considered a member of the cache, but it will no longer be searched
 * for matching chunk names.
 *
 * The second mechanism for disabling search is the heuristic based on keeping
 * track of the number of consecutive search misses in a given chapter index.
 * Once that count exceeds a threshold, the skip_search flag will be set to
 * true, causing the chapter to be skipped in the fallback search of the
 * entire cache, but still allowing it to be found when searching for a hook
 * in that specific chapter. Finding a hook will clear the skip_search flag,
 * once again allowing the non-hook searches to use the cache entry. Again,
 * regardless of the state of the skip_search flag, the virtual chapter must
 * still considered to be a member of the cache for sparse_cache_contains().
 *
 * Barrier requests and the sparse chapter index cache are also described in
 *
 * https://intranet.permabit.com/wiki/Chapter_Index_Cache_supports_concurrent_access
 *
 * and in a message to the albireo mailing list on 5/28/2011 titled "true
 * barriers with a hook resolution queue".
