/**
 * open_chapter_zone is the mutable, in-memory representation of one zone's
 * section of an Albireo index chapter.
 *
 * <p>In addition to providing the same access to records as an on-disk
 * chapter, the open chapter zone must allow records to be added or
 * modified. It must provide a way to generate the on-disk representation
 * without excessive work. It does that by accumulating records in the order
 * they are added (maintaining temporal locality), and referencing them (as
 * record numbers) from hash slots selected from the name. If the metadata for
 * a name changes, the record field is just modified in place.
 *
 * <p>Storage for the records (names and metadata) is allocated when the zone
 * is created. It keeps no references to the data passed to it, and performs
 * no additional allocation when adding records. Opening a new chapter simply
 * marks it as being empty.
 *
 * <p>Records are stored in a flat array. To allow a value of zero in a
 * hash slot to indicate that the slot is empty, records are numbered starting
 * at one (1-based). Since C arrays are 0-based, the records array contains
 * enough space for N+1 records, and the record that starts at array index
 * zero is never used or referenced.
 *
 * <p>The array of hash slots is actually two arrays, superimposed: an
 * array of record numbers, indexed by hash value, and an array of deleted
 * flags, indexed by record number. This overlay is possible because the
 * number of hash slots always exceeds the number of records, and is done
 * simply to save on memory.
