 * from most recently accessed to least recently accessed, which is the order
 * in which the indexes should be searched and the reverse order in which they
 * should be evicted from the cache (LRU cache replacement policy).
 *
 * Cache entries that are dead (virtual_chapter == UINT64_MAX) are kept as a
 * suffix of the list, avoiding the need to even iterate over them to search,
 * and ensuring that dead entries are replaced before any live entries are
 * evicted.
 *
 * The search list is intended to be instantated for each zone thread,
 * avoiding any need for synchronization. The structure is allocated on a
 * cache boundary to avoid false sharing of memory cache lines between zone
